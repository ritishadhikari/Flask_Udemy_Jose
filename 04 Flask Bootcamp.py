import flask

#Flask is a web framework that allows us to connect python code to the web
#HTML will display the page elements -- Front End
#CSS will style the elements -- Front End
#Bootstrap will provide automatic styling and components through CSS and JS - Front End
#Jinja templates are used to grab information from python and flask to send info back as HTML
#We use <form> tags to set up a form. Then we add special <input> tags to accept user information.
#Every major form element already has a corresponding input tag attribute.
#At the end we provide a submit input type to add a button for form submission
#GET requests a representation of the specified resource. Get will send back the information to our action url.
#Post submits data to be processed. We will use post once we learn how to connect a database with Flask to the form.
